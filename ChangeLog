    Report the actual *error* for CANT_GET_INTERFACE_LIST.
    
    CANT_GET_INTERFACE_LIST does *NOT* mean "No remote interfaces found.",
    as in "there are no remote interfaces"; a NULL return from
    get_remote_interface_list() and an err value of 0 means that.
    CANT_GET_INTERFACE_LIST means "something bad happened and the error
    string says what it is".  Display that error string, so when people
    report problems:
    
            https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/issues/666
    
    they'll give the actual error message, and I'll fix my breakage of the
    rpcap protocol negotiation:

    rather than just wondering what the problem was and asking the reporter
    of the problem for more information.
    
    Report anything other than "there are no remote interfaces" as an error,
    not a warning.

Date:   Sat Nov 11 04:29:15 2017 +0000

    TLS13: update for draft -22 (Server Hello, HRR, CCS, NST)
    
    Draft -22 moved the server version to an extension and makes HRR look
    like a SH. SH is now interpreted as TLS 1.2. Detecting TLS 1.3/HRR
    requires scanning SH extensions before parsing the message, so do that.
    
    Changes:
     - Add draft 22 version identifier.
     - Recognize special Server Hello magic for HRR.
     - Dissect SupportedVersions for SH/HRR, rename the field to match spec.
     - Recognise new Server Hello format (including legacy fields).
     - Move version detection up to handshake message dissection to allow
       HRR (disguised as SH) to be detected as such. DTLS does not have HRR
       and fragmentation makes it harder, so use its version as usual.
     - Ignore ChangeCipherSpec again for draft 22 (do not add expert info).
     - Allow NST ticket_nonce to be empty.

    packet: ensure consistent layer number for heuristics dissector
    
    DTLS decryption works for single-pass dissection, but breaks in the
    second pass. Turns out that "curr_layer_num" has decremented in the
    second pass, resulting in a failure to lookup the decrypted data.
    This decryption issue was triggered by v2.3.0rc0-3740-ge1f84f985e
    ("Fix Decode As for protocols that may use tunneling.").
    
    The first time the UDP dissector invokes "dissector_try_heuristic", the
    second time "call_heur_dissector_direct". The first one increments
    "curr_layer_num", so do the same in the second case.

    Qt: Main Welcome hover sparkline color fix.
    
    Use the default text color for sparkline in hovered items.  This makes

    3GPP NAS: fix dissection of PCO MSISDN container ID
    
    3GPP 24.008 is not very explicit regarding the encoding, but after
    rereading 3GPP 23.003 and 3GPP 29.272, it is most likely the E.164
    number in TBCD encoding (so without TON/NPI byte).

    Link with ZLIB_LIBRARIES if you link with wiretap.
    
    Wiretap may use zlib; if it does, ZLIB_LIBRARIES is set to refer to
    zlib.  On UN*X, you may be able to get away with linking a
    dynamically-linked shared library with other dynamically-linked shared
    libraries and not linking programs linked *with* that shared library
    with those other shared libraries, but that may not work on Windows.
    
    We link most programs that use wiretap with ZLIB_LIBRARIES; do so with
    androiddump and randpktdump as well.

    Use "not installed for development" for libgcrypt.
    
    This is similar phrasing to what I used for some other libraries;
    hopefully it will keep people from asking "Why am I getting this error?
    I installed libgcrypt" questions by making it clear that "installing
    libgcrypt" might not be enough.
    
    Also, don't give a package name, because the package might not be called
    "libgcrypt-devel" - it might be called "libgcrypt20-dev" of something
    such as that.

    Improve http object export for URLs with long extensions
    
    This allows the export of objects with extensions that may be longer
    than the allowed file name of an export (due to underlying filesystem, etc).
    The extension detection mechanism previously preserved everything in the file
    name after the final ".", but in some cases (especially with long query strings)
    this would exceed the allowed maximum file length, and simply refuse to export
    the object. Now, if the length of the extension and duplicate number is longer
    than the allowable file length, the extension is ignored, and the entire string
    is truncated to allow an acceptable export filename.

    [RFC] dissector/mqtt: Fix handling of fixed header flags
    
    According to the MQTT v3.1 and v3.1.1 specifications,
    the fixed header flags (DUP, QoS and RETAIN) are only set by
    the PUBLISH message.
    
    The DUP flag is also set by the PUBREL, SUBSCRIBE and
    UNSUBSCRIBE messages but only when version 3.1 is used.
    
    Currently, the MQTT dissector shows the header flags for
    all the v3.1 and v3.1.1 messages.
    
    This patch fixes the issues mentioned above.
    
    To track the protocol version used during the connection handshake
    a conversation is used. For subsequent messages, the way the header
    flags are displayed is determined by this variable.

    rlc: Fix bug in 'RLC over UDP' dissector
    
    Reassembly of AM/UM packets doesn't work when the URNTI tag is missing and the default value of 0 is kept. This patch makes the default value 1 for those cases.

    ssl: assume everything after CCS is encrypted
    
    After ChangeCipherSpec, record fragments are encrypted. Use this strong
    hint to fix misinterpreting the explicit nonce as a handshake message.
    One edge case remaing unsolved though, if an encrypted Finished message
    follows the CCS in the same TCP packet, then it could still be
    misinterpreted.

    Update comment.
    
    Red Hat, at one point, provided a /usr/include/pcap/pcap.h without
    bothering to also provide a /usr/include/pcap.h that linked to it or
    included it, breaking source compatibility.  That's what we're working
    around when we search in both the top-level include directories and, if
    they exist, pcap subdirectories of those directories.
    
    libpcap 1.0 and later also put pcap.h in a pcap subdirectory, but also
    provided a pcap.h in the top-level include directory that included
    pcap/pcap.h, preserving source compatibility, so that's not the reason
    we're searching in the top-level include directories and their pcap
    subdirectories.

    Add --print as an alias for -P, to match tcpdump.
    
    tcpdump just got a --print option, which causes packet information to be
    printed even if the raw packets are being saved to a file with -w.  We
    have -P for the same purpose; make --print another name for it.
    
    While we're at it:
    
            document --help and --version;
    
            just speak of -P/--print as causing printing even of the packet
            details, even though -V forces printing with -w, for consistency
            with how --print is documented for tcpdump;
    
            fix the description of -h/--help.

    Fuzz: Limit the number of packets we process with Valgrind.
    
    Estimating the effort required to process a capture based on its size
    isn't very reliable. Instead of rejecting files that are too large, just
    limit Valgrind fuzzing to the first 100,000 packets in each file. This
    should fix a timeout issue we're seeing on the master fuzzer.
